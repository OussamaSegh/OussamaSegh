## üíº Experience

- **Software Engineer at Forsk**
Forsk is a software company specializing in wireless network design and optimization products.

I maintained and added features to their flagship product, Atoll‚Äîa Windows software developed in C++17 with a Python API, used for designing and optimizing wireless communication networks.

In the Dev-Support team, I investigated and resolved client-reported bugs and issues using advanced debugging techniques, dump analysis, and performance profiling. I collaborated with the support team to address and resolve critical issues for clients.

Primarily working in the ACP team, I was responsible for the Automatic Cell Planning module in Atoll, which optimizes multi-technology mobile networks using metaheuristic algorithms where performance is critical. I engaged in the full development lifecycle of new features, including specification with the product owner, architecture design, development, and bug fixing. Additionally, I performed code reviews, optimized algorithms, and refactored both code and design.

Acquired skills include: software design, algorithmics, debugging, performance optimization, C++17, MFC, Git, Python, Windows API, and teamwork.
